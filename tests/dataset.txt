Labrynth City Nights

“I have no interest in it.” Kirin said to Jake before looking around the kitchen island. “Listen,” he continued. “The only place a detective would go looking for a murder is into the local labyrinths that run through the hills north of here.” Kirin continued. “I do hope you have your wits about this case.”

“What? How am I supposed to make them tell me who the killer is?”

“Duty,” Kirin smiled as he picked up the bowl and began to boil it again. “Ask them to pull out the bag until I see a sign that there’s nothing about him here that points to him being a Murderer.”

“Well…” Jake said turning the case over in his hands. “That didn’t seem like a threat then.”

“It is when you find a scapegoat for the murders, Togusa,” Kirin said.

“As then?”

“Get them both out of here and send me home.” Kirin said turning the case over in his hands again. “What do you think?”

“Isn’t there anything that’ll stop a man striking a woman?”

“Nothing that’ll stop a man in his quest?”

“You’re wrong, Kray.” Kirin said throwing back his hood and wiping a smear of blood from the corner of his mouth. “He wasn’t there, which is why you’re wrong.”

“What? Why would you stop calling me a suspect?”

“Because that’s what you’re a detective for, right?”

“Well,” Jake said lowering his head. “Do we have any clue as to how this killer found the Mermaid to tempt the murderer?”

“You’re the detective.” Kirin said.

“So?”

“You’re going after the culprit yourself.”

“As I was saying before,” Kirin continued.

“A suspect?”

“Yes.”

“Do you have any evidence that the killer is your own uncle?”

“Nah. We had the poor man nagging me to look for any tidbit of information and shrugged until I found nothing. It was a complete surprise that he would not provide such vital information before murdering his own nephew for not providing information for me. That’s why I went and spoke to him anyway.”

“What do you plan to do with him?”

“Same as what we did with the vixen, I plan to ask him what he thinks.”

“What do you plan to do with the man?”

“Call the police.”

“Perhaps. And with the Mermaid here, it’s your best chance of getting away with passing the easy way. Besides, even if you were the culprit, would the messenger still be a family man?”

Kara frowned at the sudden question. “My nsa’s the same, don’t we?”

“Now that’s a canna tone!” Kirin laughed. “Can for you, not a call.”

“Ahah,” Karate Instructor called out to the nervous Karate. “What sorta thing is this, ya? You’re cory!” he said raising his voice for attention.

“Cory it is,” Yumi said quite loudly, pushing her way through the laughter of the students as she glared at them, calling out “Cory! Cary! Cary! Cary!”

“C’mon, already you tell yourself,” Kirin smirked as he pulled the muddy coat from the student. “I’m the Detective Academy and you’re the Unions—the debt is ours.” Kirin nodded as he walked over to a trash can and knocked it as the sound of running footsteps. “Let’s get him out of here.” He helped Jacob pull the body of the young man into the hallway of the building. As the students moved to assist with the effort, Kirin stood by Jacob, wondering if this man was the culprit.

“What is that thing?” Kirin asked.

“Running and weaving its own dance, that’s what it did,” Jake said as he shoved Kirin to the side. “We have to find out what this one’s planning before the suspect can walk a mile in any direction.”

“What are you talking about? This guy is an even stranger. Why would he take the risk of attacking his own brother?”

“Who knows, if he already had the bags, why not just whip it by the ankles and run and make sure he didn’t have the bags dragged inside.”

“Maybe he didn’t have the bags.”

“Let’s find a bag.”

“No, as long as he has those masks on, he’s vulnerable to strangers.”

“Now comes your turn.” Kirin said turning around and back towards the front door as he held the shoulder of the short blond boy with the striped cap perched on his head to steer him out the door as they walked down the hallway. Nearing the door, he could see the bouncers as they gave the all-clear to the young couple who entered the building and waved them in. As they did, the door opened to reveal the bouncers pushing in the front door with rifles as they shouted sternly to the young man inside, firing their rifles utterantly at them until a few of them fired back at them and someone grabbed their hand.

“Come on!” the short blond man shouted, waving his hands as they pulled them in and the officers as they yelled threats until the young man grabbed a gun to the hand of the woman holding them and dragged the couple out the front door. As the bouncers proceeded by holding the door more firmly against the brawling stream of people, Jake entered.

“Let’s go.” He whispered as the bouncers chased him outside the building.

“Whoa!” Kirin said in shock as he looked on with disbelief at the situation. “Jake?” he said turning around to see Kirin.

“Hey, I’m going to the store.” He said opening a door beside the flagging signs, for all the crowd to see the same heavily scarred, tattooed face as it stuck to the barrier.

“Parking in front of the building.” Jake said. “I’m going to buy some fancy clothes for you and something’s the top priority.”

“Alright.” Kirin nodded, looking around the garage. “Where’s the Jeep?”

“I don’t know.”

“Let’s go.”

Jake turned around to see Kirin already walking towards a Jeep that was parked behind the counter of a convenience store. Sitting inside the passenger seat, Kirin glanced around to the shoppers and the young man in the buggy.

“I hope you have your key.” Kirin said.

Jake shook his head, but he kept his eyes on Kirin.

“Whatever.” He said ignoring the fact that you definitely have your key.

The bouncers looked on with restrained skepticism.

“Have fun in the Jeep.” Kirin said.

As Jake turned around and inside the cage, he said, “I have to tell you, the key’s not in the backseat, you’re going to find it yourself.”

“Is it?” Kirin asked.

“Yeah, I’m giving it to you.”

“What is it?”

“It’s a set of leather codes.”

“Ok, let’s go.” Kirin said, grabbing a fistful of leather codes and throwing them on the back door of the jeep.

“Damn,” the short blond boy screamed out beside the stunned Jake. “You think I know everything?”

“I know a lot of things.”

“That’s why you’re here, right?”

“Yeah…”

“Let’s go.”

Jake turned around and looked at the prissy face of Kirin as he walked into the jeep with the codes.

“You can’t do this.” He said waving him over to the tired Jake.

“This isn’t our place for kids.” Jake said. “We don’t want those little pills and stuff coming in your bloodstream.”

“Forget them.” Kirin said ignoring the furious words of Jake.

“What are you, a detective?” the short blond man said. “You’re here to chase away rioters, nothing more.”

“Listen,” Kirin said stepping into the passenger side of the jeep with his assistant beside him. “I’m the last person in this jeep with any booths or chairs. We have no place to sit.”

“No,” the boy said paying his post by grabbing a chair. “This is my family land, the best family property in the city, listen to me?”

“You should know better.” Kirin said looking back at the two boys. “I can take your picture, the moment I see you.”

The boy looked relieved. “Ah…” he said lifting his head a bit. “Sorry, my part of the business is in that.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” Kirin smiled, happy to have allowed the boy to follow him. As he did, Jake looked over to the shocked face of Kirin. “What are you doing?” he asked.

“I want to ask you a favor.” Kirin smiled. “You might be willing to do that for me.”

Jake shook his head. “Why would you think that?”

“Because it’s always good to have business when I have people with skill to let.” Kirin continued with his aggressive statement.

The boy Skulked as he slumped in the seat. “Listen, I want you to take me to the Walled City.” He said pulling out a key card.

“What’s this?” Jake asked.

“It’s a Hunt. You know this place, right?”

“No.” Skulked said.

“Well, it’s expensive, so it might as well be the best place to go. You know…”

“To where?”

“Haven’t you already heard? The City of Teigen is bustling, the Crowd flow is crazy, all the TVs are playing, and it’s all recruiting people, so there’s a huge demand for callos who want to work at the best of places in the city. So well, this is your city, here, and you’re making damn good ones of yourself.”

“The Walled City…” Jake said confused by his sudden speech.

“Exactly.”

“This place has its own name, right?”

“No.” Skulker said deeply. “It’s called the Walled City, but the people that live here don’t know it yet, I mean, they read the news, but they don’t care about the place called the Walled City. This is where the corporate-luxury goods go when the city’s just a broken sewer.”

Jake looked on with disbelief at his words. “To where?” he asked.

“Haven’t you seen it?” the boy asked.

“It’s in the middle of the city.” Jake said looking at the broken corner.

“What is?” he said looking at the side of the large graveyard.

“Jesus Rice, I just read a story about it.”

“I already did.” Jake said disappointed.

“Why would it be in the middle of the city?” he asked.

“The light towards the outside comes from like light breaking.”

Jake looked on with disbelief at his sudden knowledge, but recovered himself. “Let’s go, let’s get out of here.” He said rubbing the side of his head as they walked out of the cemetery.

Kara looked on with fear. “We’re under the tomb now.” she said gazing at the darkness that followed behind them. “My mind is playing tricks on me again.”

“I don’t know.” she said with dread as she looked around the darkness. “Just tell me something.”

Jake looked at her. “You really haven’t been reading all this?”

“Yeah, maybe once in a while.” She said looking back at the darkness.

Jake shook his head. “I don’t think so.”

“There’s something bothering you?” Kirin asked.

“Hmm?” she said narrowing her eyes as she opened her mouth to say something.

“Yes.” Jake said turning his attention back to the darkness that followed behind them as they walked.

“What’s bothering you?” Kirin asked.

“That’s your dancing.”

“Ha…” Kirin laughed before noticing everyone’s eyes were focused on them, especially after hearing their words. “So that’s it.” Kirin said breaking their silence.

“What’s that thing?” Jake asked.

“That’s a dancing bear.”

“Ahaha… Well, you can’t be wrong.” Jake chuckled as he pulled a rusty pole from the floor and started twirling it in the grip of his fingers. “You see, the more the boy learns to dance, the more the boy grows for it. You see?” he said playing with the stick on the ground. As he did so, the weightless wooden ball sitting on top of the first mine from the night before slowly changed its shape and quality, from polished to matte black. With a flick of his fingers, it became silver which, with a few quick pulls, would be floated on a large plinth before slowly sliding back into the metal.

“Impossible.” Kara said.

“I guess the only way to get past the mines is to pay the four mines to come and get them. But with your money I think we can buy any dancing bear Princess for a few silver rings. So please throw that like it was before and after.”

“As you wish.” Kara said finishing up the last of the cigar before turning around and placing her palms against the bottom of the window as she leaned her arms on them. She let out a long sigh before chuckling under her breath. “I like this girl from the night before. She seems to be one of the good girls who’ve been hiding under the dark for ten years now. I wonder what she’s learned like taking that walk. I wonder what she’s taught us about living. When is it safe for us to go? Where is everyone safe?”

“They’re all in hiding. So we have to wait for others to come.”

“Forget them.” Kara said slamming the door down upon them. “We don’t need those monsters. The financial manager, the manager of the mines, the contractors, they all broke down yesterday. What are you going to do? Is your vision that clear? Or is it wrong?”

Kara looked on with uncertainty.

“You know,” Kirin said looking directly at her. “You should just go. You’re a member of the Underground here for the sake of the Underground. That’s well enough. Go on, do it.”

She looked at him in shock. “What are you talking about?”

“Why should we?” Kirin said.

“It’s a silly small thing to buy land and build a house on it. But you need a place to live, in order to help the lower-deckers and those looking for work.”

“Why?”

“We have to go places.”

“Why?”

“We have to go underground.”

“What are you going to do?”

“We’re going to change our way of life.” He said raising a hand. “But why go on a place to people in pain, I mean, why not just stick your head underground in a well?”

“Trust me…” she smiled at his words.

As she stood on the edge of the door with a bleak outlook on her face, she turned to look at Kirin standing in the doorway. Seeing the blue smirk on his face, she laughed before stumbling backwards in a hurried shuffle towards her bed.

“Hey…” Kirin said standing up from his desk. “I heard you might have something he could use.”

“I told him a few days ago that I don’t have much gemeineschaft left.”

“What’s wrong with that?” Kirin asked.

“What’s wrong with being famous?” she smiled.

“No,” Kirin shook his head. “It’s just that people come here because they want something.”

“I thought you loved yourself.”

“Well, my time on the streets wasn’t the same.” He said pointing ahead where two young girls stood in a courtyard. Swishing in the direction of their walkway, they looked for a small window where the afternoon was filled with air fresheners and first aid kits. Unstuck by their manic defenses, they were able to slip inside and find a window where they were able to look out the barely open door. Surprised by the building’s exterior, they pressed their heads against the window, listening with the security staff’s chatter. Hearing the whisper that always accompanies the sound of a breath being blown, they hurried up the stairs and to the ground level where their house was located. It was one of the most secure places in the city. They turned around as they walked in knowing that it was an anomaly not unlike the uniformed gangs outside the warehouse and the armed security guards standing outside the door.

Back at the kitchen’s door, she yelled to the guards with tears pouring down her cheeks and shook her head. “They’re just kids.”

“Why are you crying?” the guard asked.

“Why can’t you see your own tears?” she whispered.

“They protect us from things, right?”

“Yeah.”

“And girls too?”

“Well,” the guard shrugged. “They can’t protect us from themselves. We’re not all so bright.”

“Why can’t you see your own tears?”

“Our tears aren’t the ones of the children.”

“Pah…” the guard muttered.

“What did you do?” Kara asked him.

“It’s the truth.” He said looking at the worn livery house and the broken home.

“Come on,” she said waking up. “We need you to be brave for us.”

“What?” the guard said.

“It’s time for us to make our move.” She said looking around the courtyard, finding a mirror that suited her light mood.

“I don’t know, Kara. I don’t know what to do.”

“Then go out there and tell them what we need to do. I’ll be all right with you, but what about your family?”

Kara shook her head. “No, not your family. I’m the mother of all your dreams. They all died for me.” She said weeping bitterly.

“Well, that’s that.” The guard said as he pulled out the backpack and began to pack it. “That can be arranged.” He said as he opened a cabinet in the wall and pulled out a windowpane.

“When are you going to get going?” she asked through gritted teeth. The guard glanced at her with confused eyes.

“I don’t know yet.” She said laying the stress on the first word of a dream.

“You have to tell them now. Tell them this, that we need them now,” the guard said, tossing away the plastic container.

“That can be arranged.” Kara said shaking.

“Tell them that.”

“Hey!” the guard shouted, throwing his pack over the fence. “You have to drop her now.”

Kara leapt up and ran to him, hand stretched out before her throat. “Stop!” she screamed down to the guard.

He didn’t move.

They pressed their heads against the window, listening with the security staff’s chatter. Hearing the whisper that always accompanies the sound of a breath being blown, they hurried up the stairs and to the ground level where their house was located. It was one of the most secure places in the city. They turned around as they walked in knowing that it was an anomaly not unlike the uniformed gangs outside the warehouse and the armed security guards standing outside the door.

“Hey!” the guard shouted, throwing his pack over the fence. “You have to drop her now.”

Kara leapt up and ran to him, hand stretched out before her throat. “Stop!” she screamed down to the guard.

He didn’t move.

“Now.” she said pulling him down the makeshift fence that had been built around a corner of the courtyard.

The guard grabbed a rifle.

“Give him the Au Nina!” Kara shouted. The guard pulled out his battery.

The guard smiled as he turned to his hands. “Good girl,” he said as he glanced at her with a smile. “No need to be scared of a bunch of teens. It’s a Jet helicopter, you know? Super quiet. It’s been in good shape ever since you lost us in the street.”

“Gunman!” Kara shouted.

The man smiled at her words. “The f*** are you and my women trying to negotiate with you?” He laughed as he turned around and looked at the chopper.

Kara took a step back. “Easy now, that’s not what this is about. We need to get out of here.”

“No, we don’re not.” The man said firing as the bullet hit him.

“Out of the way!” Kara shouted. The guards led her out the door and onto the catwalk that led down to the V-shaped garden courtyard. Folding the royal hilts of her us from things, right?”

“Yeah.”

“And girls too?”

“Well,” the guard shrugged. “They can’t protect us from themselves. We’re not all so bright.”

“Why can’t you see your own tears?”

“Our tears aren’t the ones of the children.”

“Pah…” the guard muttered.

“What did you do?” Kara asked him.

“No, we don’re not.” The man said firing as the bullet hit him.

“Out of the way!” Kara shouted. The guards led her out the door and onto the catwalk that led down to the V-shaped garden courtyard. Folding the royal hilts of her pyromancer skirt, she rushed over to the soldiers standing nearby, eager to defend their queen.

“No!” the man shouted, swinging his rifle. “No! We’re gonna die here.”

“Damn it, Makin,” the guard shouted.

The gunfire ceased. The big beast lifted off towards the east as the sound of the gunshots faded to the distant quickly.

“Got an empty house. Kill the security guards first.”

“Forget it!” Kara shouted, running to the other side of the yard.

She took up her position against the railing of the fence, pointed her rifle directly at the man in his pit. He froze.

Another guard rushed to her side and fired his rifle.
